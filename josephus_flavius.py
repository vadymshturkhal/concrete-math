    During the Jewish-Roman war, he was among a band of 41
    Jewish rebels trapped in a cave by the Romans. Preferring suicide to capture,
    the rebels decided to form a circle and, proceeding around it, to kill every
    third remaining person until no one was left. But Josephus, along with an
    unindicted co-conspirator, wanted none of this suicide nonsense; so he quickly
    calculated where he and his friend should stand in the vicious circle.

    We start with N people numbered 1 to n around a circle,
    and we eliminate every second remaining person until only one survives.

    The elimination order is 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 3, 7, 1, 9, so 5 survives.
