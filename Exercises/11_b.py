    A Double Tower of Hanoi contains 2n disks of n different sizes, two of
    each size. As usual, we’re required to move only one disk at a time,
    without putting a larger one over a smaller one.
    
    a)  What if we are required to reproduce the original top-to-bottom
        order of all the equal-size disks in the final arrangement? [Hint:
        This is difficult-it’s really a “bonus problem.“]
